# XIAO-VoiceCapture-System


This project demonstrates a real-time voice-to-text system using the **XIAO ESP32S3 Sense** microcontroller. It captures speech via the onboard microphone, saves it as a `.wav` file, and sends it to the **Deepgram API** for transcription.

🧠 Perfect for voice-controlled IoT, embedded AI prototyping, or speech logging.
